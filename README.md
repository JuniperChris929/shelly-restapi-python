# shelly-restapi-python
Script to collect infos from Shelly Devices in python via Device RESTAPI


Simply adjust the excel-sheet with your shelly IPs (don't forget to adjust the script if you rename the sheet or the actual file), run the script and provide it with the user / pass from your shelly web UI - that's it :) 
Temperature will be shown for all devices inside the IP list
